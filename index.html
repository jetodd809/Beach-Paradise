    <h3>Bay of Bahia</h3>
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/bahia.jpeg">
    <p>Nestled on the northern end of the Isle of Caludge, this beach is cited as the most popular getaway for vacationers during peak summer months.<br />Popular activities include scuba diving, snorkeling, and bird watching.

  <div id="Salange">
    <h3>Salange Beach</h3>
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/selange.jpeg">
    <p>Selange Beach is known for its temperate sand. Made up of ground coral due to thousands of years of tectonic activity,<br />the sand is always cool to the touch, despite the heat. The western portion includes fantastic flora and fauna and many pre-Columbian ruins.

  <div id="Hunt">
    <h3>Hunt Lagoon</h3>
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/hunt.jpeg">
    <p>Known primarily for it's hidden location on Kamar Island (which includes swimming through an underground cave),<br />
      Hunt Lagoon offers a peaceful respite from the tourist-laden locations found throughout Kamar.<br />
      If possible, make a visit at night â€“ it's bioluminescent lagoon is like viewing fireworks in the water!

  <div id="Moat">
    <h3>Moat Lagoon</h3>
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/moat.jpeg">
    <p>Last, but certainly not least, is Moat Lagoon. This is one of the most difficult beach locations to access.<br />
      The lagoon is located inside of a prehistoric cenote, or underground aquifer. Accessing it involves crossing the
      moat surrounding the lagoon (hence the name)<br /> with locals by kayak. Once there, marvel at the phenomenal (and endangered) quetzal bird and its golden feathers.</p>

  <!--- The referance website for this project had the "h3"s below each beach image, I put mine above the image
  because I think it is a little less confusing for the reader--->
